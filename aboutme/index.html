    <p>Hey!I'm Rae, I'm majoring in Cybersecurity. I wanted to learn more about how devices work and how to safeguard data and secure computer systems. I'm from India and I moved to BYUI 2 and half years ago. Some things that i enjoy are coooking, singing, dancing, playing temple run, watching lots and lots of movies, going to the gym and recently I've been enjoying reading books.</p>
    <p1>I'm currently working on BYUI campus with Event Services. I think BYU-Idaho is a great place to study because the professors are very kind and helpful, there's tons of resources that we can take advantage of, to build a good career path for ourselves and I also love that everyone is very kind to each other. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Cybersecurity.</p1>
    <p2>The biggest advantage of learning web desgin is to understand the structure and the work behind a web page and how to build one, this forms the foundation for any tech major. And I'm hoping I learn how to create web pages and also how to problem solve if there are any issues with a web page. </p2>
    <p3>I have been a member of the Church for my whole life, and I believe my true conversion and my journey to build my own testimoney started when I was 13. My favorite quote is by Elder Neal A. Maxwell, "God does not begin by asking us about our ability, but only about our availability, and if we then prove our dependability, He will increase our capability!". And one of my favorite Scripute is from Doctrine & Covenants 121: 7-8, "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; 8. And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on High;</p3>
